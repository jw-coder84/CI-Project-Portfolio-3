# Objective

* The application lets the user add games to a spreadsheet. The information required for each record is the games title, genre and the platform the game is available for. 
* Another function allows users to vote for any of the games on the list. The number of votes will be recorded on the spreadsheet. 
* The final function allows users to query the spreadsheet. Users can view the top ten games on the spreadsheet based on the number of votes alone. A search by genre or platform can also be performed with the results still being organised by the number of votes. Therefore it's always a top ten chart that's being viewed, but could be the top ten adventure games or the top ten Nintendo Switch games. With a large number of games being in the list, these searches will allow users to glean further insight from the data.
